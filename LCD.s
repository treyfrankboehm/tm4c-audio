; The Data/Command pin must be valid when the eighth bit is
; sent.  The SSI module has hardware input and output FIFOs
; that are 8 locations deep.  Based on the observation that
; the LCD interface tends to send a few commands and then a
; lot of data, the FIFOs are not used when writing
; commands, and they are used when writing data.  This
; ensures that the Data/Command pin status matches the byte
; that is actually being transmitted.
; The write command operation waits until all data has been
; sent, configures the Data/Command pin for commands, sends
; the command, and then waits for the transmission to
; finish.
; The write data operation waits until there is room in the
; transmit FIFO, configures the Data/Command pin for data,
; and then adds the data to the transmit FIFO.
; NOTE: These functions will crash or stall indefinitely if
; the SSI0 module is not initialized and enabled.
