# 4-channel-audio

## This is a fork of our 319K lab 6 repo. The goal is to provide the ability to convert 4-channel MIDIs to a header file with structs that is parseable by the program to play with a six bit DAC.

## To-do:
### High priority
* Implement volume envelopes
* Add more note macros and updated BWV 578 arrangement
### Low priority
* Each MIDI event (note) specifies the relative volume
