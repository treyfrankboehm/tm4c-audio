# 4-channel-audio

## This is a fork of our 319K lab 6 repo. The goal is to provide the ability to convert 4-channel MIDIs to a header file with structs that is parseable by the program to play with a six bit DAC.

## To-do:
* Each struct specifies waveform to use
* Each note specifies the volume
* midistruct.py formats the time given an 80 MHz clock and the tempo from the MIDI
