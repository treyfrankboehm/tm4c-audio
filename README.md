# 4-channel-audio

## Goal: Feed MIDIs with up to 4 channels into the script `midistruct.py`. These header files with structs can be included as songs and played by the 6-bit DAC.

## To-do:
* Make a way to handle multiple songs (instead of Channel0, Channel1... have each `.h` file name `filename-Channel0` or whatever the case may be. Then have pointers to those that can be reassigned instead of referring directly to them. Not this branch).
* `cat * | grep -i 'todo'`
