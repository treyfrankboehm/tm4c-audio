# 4-channel-audio

## Goal: Feed MIDIs with up to 4 channels into the script `midistruct.py`. These header files with structs can be included as songs and played by the 6-bit DAC.

## To-do:
* Improve volume envelopes to make more realistic instruments.
* Each MIDI event (note) specifies its relative volume.
* Generate a noise signal to use with percussive sounds.
* Implement percussion instruments.
* `cat * | grep -i 'todo'`
